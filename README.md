# Novum Initium — Personal Portfolio

A bilingual (DE/EN) portfolio for showcasing projects, skills, and contact information, built with HTML, CSS, and lightweight JavaScript. Includes full-screen project modals and a full-screen image lightbox.

## Features
- Bilingual pages: `index.html` (DE) and `index-en.html` (EN)
- Responsive layout with mobile optimizations
- Project modals that open full-screen
- Full-screen image lightbox for project screenshots
- Touch-friendly controls and scroll locking when modals are open
- Theming via CSS variables (pine/forest palette)

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` (German) or `index-en.html` (English) directly in a modern browser.

No build step is required; this is a static site.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` — German landing page
- `index-en.html` — English landing page
- `styles.css` — Global styles, layout, responsive rules, modals, and lightbox
- `assets/` — Images for hero, LMS, warehouse, and other sections

## Usage
- Click “View Project” / “Projekt ansehen” to open a full-screen modal.
- Click any project image to open it in the full-screen lightbox.
- Close via the X button, ESC key, or clicking outside (where enabled).

## Mobile Notes
- Viewport meta tags, touch-friendly hit areas, and scroll-locking are configured for mobile.
- Buttons, links, and close controls meet minimum touch sizes.

## Accessibility & Performance
- Keyboard ESC closes modals and lightbox.
- Scroll locking prevents background scrolling when modals are open.
- Responsive typography and balanced wrapping for long titles and descriptions.
